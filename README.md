# Pong

Hello as you can see I made pong utilizing raylib :)

## Controls

W | S keys - Left paddle up down
Up ^ | Down v Arrows - Right paddle up down

## IMPORTANT 

For full disclosure I used a github project to act as a template which had a basic ball bouncing and had a c++ set up in such a way to allow for raylib programming.

The [License](LICENSE.TXT) is still attached as well to ensure I am being 100% transparent

I also utilized AI resources to answer some questions as i am quite new with C++ as a language and using raylib.

GitHub Template  [Here](https://github.com/educ8s/Raylib-CPP-Starter-Template-for-VSCODE) 

Hope you enjoy my first raylib project
